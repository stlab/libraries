# Software Technology Lab (STLab) Library Source Code Repository

ASL libraries will be migrated here in the `stlab` namespace, new libraries will be created here.

## Branch states

- **`main`:** [![Build and Tests](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/actions/workflows/stlab.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/actions/workflows/stlab.yml)

## Content

### [Concurrency](https://www.stlab.cc/libraries/concurrency/)

This library provides futures and channels, high level abstractions for implementing algorithms that eases the use of multiple CPU cores while minimizing contention. This library solves several problems of the C++11 and C++17 TS futures.

## Documentation

The complete documentation is available on the [STLab home page](http://stlab.cc).

Release changelogs are listed in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).

## Tested on

- Linux with GCC 11
- Linux with Clang 14
- MacOS 11 with Apple-clang 13.0.0
- Windows with Visual Studio 16

## Requirements

- A standards-compliant C++17, C++20, or C++23 compiler
- **Building** the library requires CMake 3.23 or later
- **Testing or developing** the library requires Boost.Test >= 1.74.0

## Building

STLab is a standard CMake project. See the [running CMake](https://cmake.org/runningcmake) tutorial
for an introduction to this tool.

### Preparation

1. Create a build directory outside this library's source tree. In this guide, we'll use a sibling
   directory called `BUILD`.

1. Install a version of CMake >= 3.23. If you are on Debian or Ubuntu Linux you may need to use
   `snap` to find one that's new enough.

1. If you are using MSVC, you may need to set environment variables appropriately for your target
   architecture by invoking `VCVARSALL.BAT` with an appropriate option.

### Configure

Run CMake in the root directory of this project, setting `../BUILD` as your build directory. The
basis of your command will be

```
cmake -S . -B ../BUILD -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=# SEE BELOW
```

but there are other options you may need to append in order to be successful. Among them:

- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=`[`Release`|`Debug`] to build the given configuration (required unless you're using visual studio or another multi-config generator).
- `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=`[`17`|`20`|`23`] to build with compliance to the given C++ standard.
- `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` if you only intend to build, but not test, this library.
- `-DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=TRUE` if you will be testing on Windows.

We also suggest the installation of [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) and its use by adding
`-GNinja` to your cmake command lineâ€¦ but ninja is not required.

A typical invocation might look like this:

```
cmake -S . -B ../BUILD -GNinja -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
```

If you organize the build directory into subdirectories you can support multiple configurations.

```
rm -rf ../builds/portable
cmake -S . -B ../builds/portable -GXcode -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DSTLAB_TASK_SYSTEM=portable -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=macosx14.4
```

### Build

If your configuration command was successful, go to your build directory (`cd ../BUILD`) and invoke:

```
cmake --build .
```

## Testing

Running the tests in the `BUILD` directory is as simple as invoking

```
ctest -C Debug
```

or

```
ctest -C Release
```

depending on which configuration (`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`) you chose to build.

## Generating Documentation

STLab uses [hyde](https://github.com/adobe/hyde) to generate documentation boilerplate by scanning its public headers. You will need to follow Hyde's installation instructions and have `hyde` on your `$PATH` (detectable by `which hyde`).

When adding a new public API, you should invoke

```
docker run --platform linux/x86_64 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/..",target=/mnt/host --tty --interactive hyde bash
```

```
cd /mnt/host/libraries
./validate_docs.sh --update
```

(or, simply `-u`) to generate the boilerplate for it. Then, fill in any fields marked as `__MISSING__`. Fields marked as `__OPTIONAL__` may be omitted.
