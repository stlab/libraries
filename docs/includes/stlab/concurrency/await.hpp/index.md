  brief: "Await provides utilities to await the value from a `future<>` synchronously and to notify the default executor that a task is waiting. Blocking calls are discouraged because they may lead to deadlocks or thread explosions.\n\nThere is a good presentation of the issues [here](https://youtu.be/Z86b3Rd09sE).\n"
