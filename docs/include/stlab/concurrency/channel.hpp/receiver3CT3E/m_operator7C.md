      description: Attaches the given annotated process to the receiver and returns a new receiver. It can either be a function object with a single parameter or a process that follows this signature. An `annotated_process` should not be explicitly instantiated but it gets implicitly created as soon as one combines a function object with an `operator&` and an `executor` or a `buffer_size` or both. L-value processes can be attached when they are wrapped within `std::reference_wrapper`.

`operator|` creates a new receiver, attaches the given process as downstream to it and returns this new receiver. The new receiver inherits the executor from its upstream receiver if not an alternative executor is attached. In case that `T` of `receiver<T>` is a move only type, repeated calls of this operator overwrite the previous attached downstream channel.
