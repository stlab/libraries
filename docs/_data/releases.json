    "body": "This is a draft of version 2.0.0. Bumping the major version number is due to the breaking changes mentioned below. I'm in the process of updating the documentation to use Hyde 2.0 and moving to use GitHub Actions to build the Jekyll pages. The final release will be done when those tasks are completed. This release is for those who \"just need the code\".\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n- C++17 or later is now required. The was done to make the executors and `task<>` noexcept aware. Executors now require the tasks being passed to them are `noexcept`. `package<>()` can be used to create noexcept `packaged_task<>`s. The `task<>` interface can now require that a captured task is `noexcept`. For example, `task<int(double) noexcept>` will accept a type invocable with a double, where the result is convertible to int, and is declared `noexcept`. This is statically checked. If `noexcept`is ommited, the task will except either a function with a matching signature, `noexcept` or not.\r\n- As part of moving to C++17, the ability to configure the library to use `boost::optional` and `boost::variant` has been removed.\r\n\r\nBug fixes and other changes are listed below.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Adds a call to pre_exit() on each example using default_executor by @fpelliccioni in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/500\r\n* new API: bool packaged_task::canceled() const by @KevinHopps in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/498\r\n* Changes to support C++14 and fixed missing include file (#501) by @sean-parent in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/503\r\n* Fix name conflict with boost math in Boost <= 1.76 by @fpelliccioni in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/499\r\n* Changed CMake paths to be robust to subprojects by @laserallan in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/507\r\n* Fixes to futures by @sean-parent in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/505\r\n* Fix typo from main_scheduler_type to main_executor_type by @nickpdemarco in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/516\r\n* Revisit Reduce by @sean-parent in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/521\r\n* Add check for C++20, make ambiguous case assume 23 by @nickpdemarco in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/522\r\n* Restore Qt5 compatibility by @touraill-adobe in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/524\r\n* Minor comment fix by @sean-parent in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/526\r\n* Requiring executor tasks are noexcept. by @sean-parent in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/528\r\n* Removing use of boost::variant and optional from stlab now that it has moved to C++17 by @thinlang in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/531\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @KevinHopps made their first contribution in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/498\r\n* @laserallan made their first contribution in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/507\r\n* @touraill-adobe made their first contribution in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/524\r\n* @thinlang made their first contribution in https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/531\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/stlab/libraries/compare/v1.7.1...v2.0.0a1",

Prior versions of the library were self-configuring but that was causing issues when headers were included in different compilation units compiled with different options.\r\n- **When using `default_executor` a call to `pre_exit()` is required prior to exiting main or invoking `std::exit()`.** It is not necessary if using `std::quick_exit()`. This allows the executor to shut down so canceled and detached tasks do not run concurrently with exit.\r\n- `blocking_get()` and associated functions have been renamed `await()`\r\n- A new operation `invoke_waiting()` was added to hint the portable `default_executor` when a task is waiting for some condition.\r\n- The `await()` does not attempt to steal tasks from the portable `default_executor` and instead will spin up additional threads (to a limit) to avoid deadlocking.\r\n\r\nSee more details in [changes.md](https://github.com/stlab/libraries/blob/main/CHANGES.md).",

This meant that you could not move a future passed to `recover()`.\r\n- Disabled the task() template constructor in the case where the passed function was a task so that it doesn't match the copy constructor. Previously if you copied a task it would compile, but infinitely recurse when executed. Now copying a task will not compile.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the task invoke arguments where always getting declared as rvalues (I think someone tried to make them universal references) - added a comment to avoid the mistake in the future.\r\n- Made the top-level task invoke actually use universal references and perfect forwarding.\r\n- Reduced the size of task for small object optimization (now will usually be size of 8 pointers, with 6 pointers of space for the small object)\r\n- Fixed tasks for objects that require more than maximum alignment.\r\n- Lifted the invoke vtable entry for task into the local task, filling an otherwise empty memory slot (on most architectures).\r\n- Removed the move() on the invoke calls in task, these were intended to make all tasks single execution, but many are not, and so this is a slightly dangerous and, as far as I know, unused optimization. If needed it could come back as a new virtual (rvalue invoke) call and only be used with the task actually is an rvalue."
