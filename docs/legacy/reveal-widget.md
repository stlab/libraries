## Basic Description

The reveal (or progressive disclosure) widget is similar to a checkbox, except it has no <code>false</code> value. (A checkbox having an explicit <code>false</code> value gives it the ability to be in an indeterminant state, when it is neither <code>true</code> nor <code>false</code>.)

## Semantics / Rationale

The basic behavior of a reveal widget is an arrow or icon that can be clicked on, at which point the arrow "turns down" and an optional panel to which the value is bound reveals itself. The alternate term "progressive disclosure" is more descriptive of the semantics, as there are extended pieces of the UI that are hidden until the user chooses to reveal them.
