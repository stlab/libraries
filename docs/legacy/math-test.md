The following two examples are from here <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Displaying_a_formula>:

(search for "Case distinctions" on the page to find this example)

$$
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
  n/2,  & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  3n+1, & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd}
\end{cases}
$$

(search for "Multiline equations" on the page to find this example)

Note- currently all forms of multiline equations appear to fail.

$$
\begin{align}
 f(x) & = (a+b)^2 \\
      & = a^2+2ab+b^2 \\
\end{align}
$$
